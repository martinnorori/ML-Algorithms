# ML Algorithms

## Overview
In this project, four classification algorithms are trained and tested on two different datasets. The algorithms were assessed and evaluated by presenting insights such as the confusion matrix, precision recall, and F1-Measure for each class, as well as, the accuracy, macro-average F1, and weighted average F1 of the models. 

## Prerequisites
Required modules:
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas

## Organization
1. Datasets should be stored in the `datasets` directory (create this directory).
2. Create the following directories:
    i. `images` (will store the graphs and the decision trees)
    ii. `performance` (will store the performances of each classifier for each dataset)

## Run
In the terminal, run the command below:
```bash
python3 main.py
